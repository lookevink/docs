You've just submitted your first Cash Offer Request!

## Receiving notifications
By default, we send out email notifications for when offer requests are approved to be sent to buyers, and when offers are made on your requests. 
<Warning>If you leave out the ListAgentEmail or set it as null in your request API call, then the email notifications for the offer request will be sent to the email used to set up the API</Warning>

Additionally, you can set up a webhook to receive notifications on key events related to your offer requests by posting to the `/wh` endpoint:
```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/wh \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "url": "https://example.com/webhook"
}'
```


## Viewing your cash offers
You can view the cash offers on your requests by getting the `/offers` endpoint:
```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/offers \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>'
```
