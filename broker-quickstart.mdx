If successful, you will receive the following response:
```json

}
```
You've just submitted your first Cash Offer Request! You can use the offer_request_id to identify it in your system & view the current status of your request.

## Receiving notifications
By default, we send out email notifications to the `ListAgentEmail` for when offer requests are approved to be sent to buyers, and when offers are made on your requests. 
<Warning>If you leave out the ListAgentEmail or set it as null in your request API call, then the email notifications for the offer request will be sent to the email used to set up the API</Warning>

Additionally, you can set up a webhook to receive notifications on key events related to your offer requests by posting to the `/wh` endpoint:
```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/wh \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "url": "https://example.com/webhook"
}'
```

When an offer request is approved, we'll send a POST request to the webhook URL you provided with the following JSON body:
```json
{
  "offer_request_id": 188,
  "offer_request_status": "receiving_offers"
}
```

When an offer is made on your request, we'll send a POST request to the webhook URL you provided with the following JSON body:
```json
{
  "offer_id": 88,
  "offer_request_id": 144,
  "offer_amount": 3800000,
  "created_at": "2024-05-18T00:27:44.993+00:00",
  "offer_expires": "2024-05-18T00:21:50.714+00:00",
  "offer_memo": "",
  "offer_status": "active",
  "additional_terms": null,
  "earnest_money": 0,
  "em_hard_post_inspection": false,
  "lease_back": false,
  "lease_back_period": 0,
  "flexible_closing": false,
  "post_possession": false,
  "waive_warranty": false,
  "inspection_period": 10,
  "post_possession_period": 0,
  "offer_is_counter_offer": null,
  "offer_decided_at": null,
  "test": null
}
```


## Viewing all your cash offers

## Responding to offers

    "offer_status": "rejected"

```


## Countering offers
If you have an offer that you'd like to counter, you can do so by posting to the `/counter-offers` endpoint:

```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/counter-offers \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "offer_id": 123,
  "counter_offer_amount": 123,
  "counter_offer_memo": "<string>",
  "counter_offer_expires": "<string>",
  "counter_offer_terms": {},
  "counter_offer_status": "<string>",
  "counter_earnest_money": 123,
  "counter_em_hard_post_inspection": true,
  "counter_lease_back": true,
  "counter_lease_back_period": 123,
  "counter_flexible_closing": true,
  "counter_post_possession": true,
  "counter_waive_warranty": true,
  "counter_inspection_period": 123,
  "counter_post_possession_period": 123,
  "test": true
}'
```


<Warning>If the buyer accepts your counter offer, we will reject **all** other offers made on your offer request. Only use a counter offer if you are prepared for the buyer to accept instanceof.</Warning>
