You've just submitted your first Cash Offer Request! You can use the offer_request_id to identify it in your system & view the current status of your request.

## Preliminary Request

Not ready to submit a full request yet? You can also check out how many buyers and buy boxes a property matches by hitting the preliminary request endpoint:

```curl
curl --location 'https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/offer-requests/prelim' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
--data '{
    "inventory": {
        "StateOrProvince": "CA",
        "PostalCode":"94507",
        "BedroomsTotal": 3,
        "BathroomsFull": 2,
        "LivingArea": 2650,
        "LotSizeSquareFeet": 6000,
        "ParkingTotal": 2,
        "YearBuilt": 1990,
        "ListPrice": 250000,
        "OccupantType": "Owner",
        "PoolPrivateYN": false,
        "StandardStatus": "Off-market"
    }
}'
```

## Receiving notifications

By default, we send out email notifications to the `ListAgentEmail` for when offer requests are approved to be sent to buyers, and when offers are made on your requests.

<Warning>
  If you leave out the ListAgentEmail or set it as null in your request API
  call, then the email notifications for the offer request will be sent to the
  email used to set up the API
</Warning>

Additionally, you can set up a webhook to receive notifications on key events related to your offer requests by posting to the `/wh` endpoint:

```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/wh \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "url": "https://example.com/webhook"
}'
```

When an offer request is approved, we'll send a POST request to the webhook URL you provided with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "offer_request_id": 888,
  "offer_request_status": "receiving_offers"
}
```

When an offer is made on your request, we'll send a POST request to the webhook URL you provided with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "offer_id": 888,
  "offer_request_id": 888,
  "created_at": "2024-08-16T14:39:40.868004+00:00",
  "offer_amount": 500000,
  "buyer_pays_buyer_broker_commission": false,
  "buyer_pays_listing_broker_commission": false,
  "buyer_broker_commission_pct": 3,
  "listing_broker_commission_pct": 3,
  "offer_expires": "2024-08-18T14:39:32.806+00:00",
  "offer_memo": "",
  "offer_status": "active",
  "additional_terms": null,
  "earnest_money": 0,
  "em_hard_post_inspection": false,
  "lease_back": false,
  "lease_back_period": 0,
  "flexible_closing": false,
  "post_possession": false,
  "waive_warranty": false,
  "inspection_period": 10,
  "post_possession_period": 0,
  "offer_is_counter_offer": null,
  "offer_decided_at": null,
  "test": null,
  "viewed": false,
  "external_id": null,
  "offer_feedback": null,
  "offer_request_external_id": null
}
```

In the offer above, the `offer_request_id` is the same as the `offer_request_id` in the response from the `/offer_requests` endpoint.
If you provided a `offer_request_external_id`, that gets returned as well. You can use that to identify the offer in your system.

Now, let's take a look at the offer itself. The buyer made an offer of `$500,000` on your request.
Because both `buyer_pays_buyer_broker_commission` and `buyer_pays_listing_broker_commission` are false,
buyer has indicated that the offer assumes seller pays both buyer and listing broker commissions.

Buyer broker commission goes to ESO, and is locked at `3%`, while listing broker commission is variable. In the above transaction, seller is responsible for `$500,000 * 3% = $15,000` in buyer broker commission, as well as `$500,000 * 3% = $15,000` in listing broker commission.

The seller is expected to net `$470,000` before other closing costs from the transaction.

## Responding to offers

At this point, you can do one of three things with the cash offer:

- Accept it
- Reject it
- Counter it

We expect each broker to respond to offers on each property.
Buyer has signed a binding buyer participation agreement with ESO, and by making the cash offer, has strong intent to close.
We encourage agents to counter offers if they believe the initial offer falls outside of expected range, instead of rejecting.

We hold both parties of the transaction accountable to being responsive.

### Accepting an offer

You can accept an offer by sending a PATCH request to the `/offers` endpoint with offer_status as `accepted`:

```curl
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/offers/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <key>' \
--data '{
    "offer_id": 888,
    "offer_status": "accepted"
}'
```

<Note>
  Once you accept an offer, our acquisitions team will be notified and reach out
  to you with next steps.
</Note>
<Warning>
  Once you accept **one** offer, **all** of the other offers and counter offers
  you made will be **rejected**.
</Warning>

### Rejecting an offer

You can reject an offer by sending a PATCH request to the `/offers` endpoint with offer_status as `rejected`:

```curl
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/offers/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <key>' \
--data '{
    "offer_id": 88,
    "offer_status": "rejected"
}'
```

## Countering offers

If you have an offer that you'd like to counter, you can do so by posting to the `/counter-offers` endpoint:

```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/counter-offers \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "offer_id": 123,
  "counter_offer_amount": 500000,
  "buyer_pays_buyer_broker_commission": true,
  "buyer_pays_listing_broker_commission": true,
  "listing_broker_commission_pct": 2,
  "counter_offer_memo": "<string>",
  "counter_offer_expires": "<string>",
  "counter_offer_terms": {},
  "counter_offer_status": "<string>",
  "counter_earnest_money": 123,
  "counter_em_hard_post_inspection": true,
  "counter_lease_back": true,
  "counter_lease_back_period": 123,
  "counter_flexible_closing": true,
  "counter_post_possession": true,
  "counter_waive_warranty": true,
  "counter_inspection_period": 123,
  "counter_post_possession_period": 123,
  "test": true
}'
```

In the counter offer above, you indicate that the seller is willing to accept a counter offer of `$500,000`, if the buyer agrees to paying the commissions.
You have also adjusted the `listing_broker_commission_pct` to 2.0%, demonstrating your intent as listing broker to surrender 1% of the the offer amount to the buyer.

If the buyer accepts this counter offer, the expected net cost to buyer is `$500,000 * (100% + 3% + 2%) = $525,000` before other closing & reno costs.
If the buyer accepts this counter offer, a new offer with status of `accepted` will be created, and your endpoint will get the same webhook as normal.
If the buyer rejects this counter offer, you will get an `UPDATE` call to your callback.

<Warning>
  If the buyer accepts your counter offer, we will reject **all** other offers
  made on your offer request. Only use a counter offer if you are prepared for
  the buyer to accept it.
</Warning>

## Viewing all your cash offers
