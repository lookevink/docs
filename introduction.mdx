## Obtaining access
With great power comes great responsibility, so we must review and grant access individually. After you complete the relevant agreements,
we will provide you with an API key. Check out our [buyer](/buyer-quickstart) or [broker](/broker-quickstart) quickstart guide.

## Development & Support
You can start testing the endpoint without ever leaving this documentation page. Simply head to our [playground](/api-reference/endpoint/get-offer-requests) to enter your API key
 and start making API calls.

You can email us at [kevin@easystreetoffers.com](kevin@easystreetoffers.com) for support. Check out our [discord](https://discord.gg/PWDTzE8p) to see what other developers are doing.
