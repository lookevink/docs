## Accessing our Opportunities
During the discovery calls, we should have set up your customized access based on your use case. To view your current opportunities,
you can view the list of our active cash offer requests ("offer requests") by getting the `/offer-requests` endpoint:
```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/offer-requests \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>'
```
<Note>You can make this call and view response payload directly in our [playground](/api-reference/endpoint/get-offer-requests)</Note>

You will get something like this:
```json
[
    {
        "request": {
            "offer_request_id": 188,
            "offer_requested_at": "2024-05-22T21:52:19.588454+00:00",

Fields named with Pascal Case convention follow the [RESO 2.0](https://ddwiki.reso.org/display/DDW20/Data+Dictionary+2.0+Wiki) standard. Because we have 100+ fields per property, we've hidden the fields with null as values. 
To view a list of all possible return fields, please visit our [API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/get-offer-requests).

## Making a cash offer
The `offer_request_id` uniquely identifies a cash offer request. To make a cash offer, you can post to the `/offers` endpoint:
```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://v2.easystreetoffers.com/api/v2/offers \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "offer_request_id": 123,
  "offer_amount": 123,
  "offer_expires": "<string>",
  "offer_memo": "<string>",
  "additional_terms": {},
  "earnest_money": 123,
  "em_hard_post_inspection": true,
  "lease_back": true,
  "lease_back_period": 123,
  "flexible_closing": true,
  "post_possession": true,
  "waive_warranty": true,
  "inspection_period": 123,
  "post_possession_period": 123,
  "test": true
}'
```
<Note>Note the `"test":true` field. This offer will be sent to the void and not visible to our agents, so be sure to remove it or set it as false in production</Note>

  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "url": "https://example.com/webhook"
}'
```
