title: Update Offer Request
openapi: patch /offer-requests/{offer_request_id}

Currently, we only allow `ListAgentFirstName`, `ListAgentLastName`,`ListAgentEmail`, `ListAgentDirectPhone` and `media` fields to be updated. This allows you to provide us with the listing agent to close the transaction, and for property photos to be added.
